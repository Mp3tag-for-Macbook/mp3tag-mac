##  What is Mp3tag for Mac?

**Mp3tag for Mac** is a professional-grade audio file metadata editor meticulously designed for macOS users. It combines powerful tagging functionality with a visually streamlined interface, enabling both beginners and audio power users—including musicians, DJs, podcasters, and archivists—to organize their libraries with precision.

At its core, Mp3tag offers **batch processing of metadata** across numerous audio and video formats, such as MP3, MP4, M4A, M4V, FLAC, OGG, OPUS, AIF, DSF, MPC, WAV, and WebM. Whether you're updating album info, artist names, track numbers, or genres, Mp3tag can handle hundreds or even thousands of files in one go.

The application supports **online tag and album art retrieval** from trusted metadata services like Discogs and MusicBrainz, greatly reducing manual data entry and ensuring consistent, accurate metadata across your library. It also integrates **cover art management**, allowing you to embed album images with tag updates or edit artwork directly within the app.

File and tag automation is taken to the next level with **action groups**—custom workflows that let you combine several tasks into one repeatable sequence. For instance, you can rename files, adjust tag case formatting, embed cover art, and apply regex replacements in a single batch operation.

Another key feature is **flexible tagging**: Mp3tag allows you to define custom tag fields and columns, giving users fine-grained control over how metadata is displayed and manipulated in the Tag Panel and File List.

The software runs natively on Apple Silicon and macOS versions from Mojave through Sonoma, ensuring smooth, high-performance workflows even with extensive libraries.

Lastly, Mp3tag is built by Florian Heidenreich and is well-supported through official documentation, active community forums, and frequent updates.
